            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="introduction-text">
                I am Ferdinand (or Fabian, depends where you know me from), an enthusiast of both technology and the creative arts. 
                Currently, I support researchers at the University of Applied Science Utrecht (Hogeschool Utrecht) 
                with topics around AI and Data Science by means of advising, upskilling through training/workshops,
                support in writing technical sections, and executing projects that require programming expertise.
                See the <a href="https://datasciencepool.hu.nl" target="_blank">website of our team</a> if interested in what we do!
            </p>
            <p class="introduction-text">
                As a side-gig, I help in the organisation of the yearly <a href="https://improbable.com/ig/archive/2024-ceremony/">Ig Nobel Prize ceremony</a> - for science that first
                makes you laugh and then makes you think - and everything else Improbable, something I get to partake in 
                with my lovely partner under the good graces of Marc Abrahams. 
            </p>
            <p class="introduction-text">
                Aside from (and sometimes luckily as part of) all this, I recently started forming my artistic voice. 
                What intrigues me is the meeting point of technology and creativity, of the arts and sciences, and 
                specifically the question 'How can technology help us make sense of our world, and ourselves?'. 
            </p>
            <p class="introduction-text">
                Anyhoo, this page is a short portfolio of some of the work I've done, hopefully it can provide some value
                to you.
            </p>
            <p class="introduction-text">
                Cheers,
            </p>
